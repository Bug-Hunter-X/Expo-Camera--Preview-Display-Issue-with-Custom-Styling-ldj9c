The solution lies in ensuring that the Camera component has the correct dimensions and is properly integrated within its parent view's layout. Avoid conflicting styles that might interfere with the camera's rendering process. Here's corrected code:

```javascript
// Correct styling to resolve camera preview issues
<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
  <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={Camera.Constants.Type.back}>
    {/* Camera children, if any */}
  </Camera>
</View>
```

Key improvements:

* **Consistent Flexbox:** The parent `View` uses `flex: 1` to ensure the camera occupies the entire available space.
* **Avoiding Conflicting Styles:**  The solution removes unnecessary background colors or other styles that might obstruct the camera preview.
* **Direct Child:** The `Camera` component is a direct child of the view, simplifying the layout. This prevents potential conflicts that may arise with nested views and styling.
