This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom styling.  The preview of the camera might not display correctly, appearing as a blank screen or showing distorted visuals. This is often related to the interaction of the camera component's dimensions and the surrounding layout elements within the application.  Incorrectly set flex styles or dimensions can prevent the camera from rendering properly.  Here's an example of how the bug can manifest:

```javascript
// Incorrect styling leading to camera preview issues
<View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
  <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={Camera.Constants.Type.back} />
</View>
```
